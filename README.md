# PimpMyMeal

Project of the semester S5 for the module "Mobile Application Development for Android" (II.3510) of the Software specialty at Isep (year A3 (Master 2))

The goal is to design and create an app on a chosen concept, based on an external API.

The chosen app is named "Pimp My Meal", and based on the "Recipe Search and Diet" API by Edaman

The goal is to help the user plan his meals and find recipes.
The user provides which ingredients he has at his disposal, and based on that, the app offers two main features:
 - Suggest a meal to cook with the given ingredients
 - Generate a groceries list, based on the meals the user wants to eat, and the ingredients he already have.

The full instructions and specification (for example additional functionalities) will be available in the doc/ directory.
